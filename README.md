## Simple I/O-Based Chess Implementation

#### Note: Worked on this in school, will come back to update it to be a custom windowed app with custom piece PNG support in the future (maybe)

## UPDATE - THE PROJECT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO WORK WITH GUI, I/O CODE IS STILL IN THE SOURCE CODE BUT COMMENTED OUT

## Setup

### Prerequisites (for Windows): You need to have CMake and MinGW32 installed in order to be able to compile and run the program.
### The steps are similar for Linux and Mac, but you would just need to use make instead, and pass different arguments to cmake.
 
### Go to build directory, open a bash terminal and run

```bash
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
```

### Once there are files within the directory, and if you run into no issues, run

```bash
cmake --build .
```

### This will create a local executable. You can run this executable locally on the terminal, currently the game is very basic.
